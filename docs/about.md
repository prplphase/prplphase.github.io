# About Me

My name is Wilkerson (you can call me Will). I'm a Data Engineer focused on **Analytics Engineering**, bridging the gap between data, context, and business. With a background in Systems Analysis and specializations in Data Engineering and Data Science, my work involves building and orchestrating pipelines that turn raw data into clear, scalable solutions that support decision-making.
